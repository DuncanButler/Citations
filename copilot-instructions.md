# GitHub Copilot Instructions

These instructions help guide how GitHub Copilot assists with this project.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a system for extracting, managing, and documenting citations generated by GitHub Copilot in code comments.

## Standard Citation Format

When adding code that requires citation, use the following standard format:

```python
# [CITATION] Source: https://example.com/resource
# [CITATION] Author: Example Author
# [CITATION] Date: 2025-06-05
# [CITATION] Description: Brief explanation of what was referenced

def my_function():
    # Function implementation here
```

```javascript
// [CITATION] Source: https://example.com/resource
// [CITATION] Author: Example Author
// [CITATION] Date: 2025-06-05
// [CITATION] Description: Brief explanation of what was referenced

function myFunction() {
    // Function implementation here
}
```

## Key Components

1. Citation extraction from code files
2. Citation documentation generation in multiple formats
3. VS Code extension for interactive usage

## Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints for all Python functions
- Write docstrings for all classes, methods, and functions
- Use TypeScript for VS Code extension development
- Maintain test coverage for core functionality
